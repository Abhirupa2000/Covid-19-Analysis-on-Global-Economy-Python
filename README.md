# Covid-19-Analysis-on-Global-Economy-Python

The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, I analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and various impacts of covid-19 on the economy including variables like Stringency Index, Human Development Index, GDP.

The dataset I am using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about:

- the country code
- name of all the countries
- date of the record
- Human development index of all the countries
- Daily covid-19 cases
- Daily deaths due to covid-19
- stringency index of the countries
- the population of the countries
- GDP per capita of the countries

In this repository, the following have been included:
1. The Jupyter notebook named "Covid 19 Analysis on Global economy.ipynb"
2. All the charts in html format that have been plotted
3. Datasets covid_raw_data.csv and covid_transformed_data.csv
